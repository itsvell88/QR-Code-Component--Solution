## My process

### Built with

- Html (Built & styled)

### What I learned

I got more familiar with writing HTML and started learning how to build a responsive page using basic CSS. I also worked on organizing my files better and writing cleaner, more readable code. Using semantic HTML tags was new for me, but I can see how it makes the structure easier to understand. I also got better at spotting small errors in my code, which helped a lot during testing.

### Continued development

I want to get better at keeping my code tidy and well-organized, so itâ€™s easier to read and work with. I'm also still getting used to using proper HTML tags (like <h1>, <p>, etc.) and want to keep improving how I structure my pages.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) - This resource helped me understand HTML tags and their functions. It's especially useful for beginners like me who are still getting familiar with HTML.
